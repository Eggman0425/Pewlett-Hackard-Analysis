## Summary
As the “silver tsunami” begins to make impact at Pwelett Hackard, there will be approximately 90,000 roles that will eventually need to be filled. There are approximately 1,940 retirement-ready employees in each department, which is not enough to mentor the next generation. Since some of the retiring employees are in senior positions, another query could be done into the number of non-retiring employees who could be eligible for the mentorship program for lower-level positions. Another table could be made that expands the mentorship eligibility constraints in order to utilize more retirement-ready employees to help mentor the younger employees.
